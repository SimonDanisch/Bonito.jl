You can insert the Styles object into a DOM node, and it will be rendered as a <style> node. If you assign it directly to DOM.div(style=Style(...)), the styling will be applied to the specific div. Note, that per Session, each unique css object in all Styles across the session will only be rendered once. This makes it easy to create Styling inside of components, while not worrying about creating lots of Style nodes on the page. There are a two more convenience constructors to make Styles a bit easier to use:\n\nStyles(pairs::Pair...) = Styles(CSS(pairs...))\nStyles(priority::Styles, defaults...) = merge(Styles(defaults...), priority)\n\nFor styling components, it's recommended, to always allow user to merge in customizations of a Style, like this:\n\nfunction MyComponent(; style=Styles())\n    return DOM.div(style=Styles(style, \"color\" => \"red\"))\nend\n\nAll Bonito components are stylable this way.\n\ninfo: Info\nWhy not Hyperscript.Style?

This is pretty important, since every time you display the app, listeners will get registered to it, that will just continue staying there until your Julia process gets closed. bind_global prevents that by binding the observable to the life cycle of the session and cleaning up the state after the app isn't displayed anymore. If you serve the App via a Server, be aware, that those globals will be shared with everyone visiting the page, so possibly by many users concurrently.\n\nglobal some_observable = Observable(\"global hello world\")\nApp() do session::Session\n    bound_global = bind_global(session, some_observable)\n    return DOM.div(bound_global)\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api.html#Bonito.Asset","page":"Api","title":"Bonito.Asset","text":"Represent an asset stored at an URL.

You can insert the Styles object into a DOM node, and it will be rendered as a <style> node. If you assign it directly to DOM.div(style=Style(...)), the styling will be applied to the specific div. Note, that per Session, each unique css object in all Styles across the session will only be rendered once. This makes it easy to create Styling inside of components, while not worrying about creating lots of Style nodes on the page. There are a two more convenience constructors to make Styles a bit easier to use:\n\nStyles(pairs::Pair...) = Styles(CSS(pairs...))\nStyles(priority::Styles, defaults...) = merge(Styles(defaults...), priority)\n\nFor styling components, it's recommended, to always allow user to merge in customizations of a Style, like this:\n\nfunction MyComponent(; style=Styles())\n    return DOM.div(style=Styles(style, \"color\" => \"red\"))\nend\n\nAll Bonito components are stylable this way.\n\ninfo: Info\nWhy not Hyperscript.Style? While the scoped styling via Hyperscript.Style is great, it makes it harder to create stylable components, since it doesn't allow the deduplication of CSS objects across the session. It's also significantly slower, since it's not as specialized on the deduplication and the camelcase keyword to css attribute conversion is pretty costly.
