# Static Sites

There are several ways to generate static sites with JSServe.
The simplest one is to use the Revise based `interactive_server`:

```@docs
interactive_server
```

When exporting interactions defined within Julia not using Javascript, one can use, to cache all interactions:

```@docs
JSServe.record_states
```
