`JSServe.jl` is a pretty simple package allowing to render HTML and serve it from within Julia and build up a communication bridge with the Browser. This allows to combine any of your Julia applications with libraries like [WGLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/dev/documentation/backends/wglmakie/index.html#export) and create interactive Dashboards like this:

JSServe is tightly integrated with WGLMakie, which makes them a great pair for high performance, interactive visualizations.
If performance is not a high priority, many other plotting/visualization libraries which overload the Julia display system should work with `JSServe.jl` as well.

`JSServe.jl` itself tries to stay out of major choices like the HTML/CSS/Javascript framework to use for creating UIs and Dashboards.

It uses plain HTML widgets for UI elements where it can, and only to give some base convenience, there is `JSServe.TailwindDashboard` which gives the basic JSServe widgets some nicer look and make it a bit easier to construct complex layouts.

As you can see in `JSServe/src/tailwind-dashboard.jl`, it's just a thin wrapper around the basic `JSServe.jl` widgets, which gives them some class(es) to style them via [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Anyone can do this with their own CSS or HTML/Javascript framework, which should help to create a rich ecosystem of extensions around `JSServe.jl`.

## Quickstart

```@setup 1
using JSServe
JSServe.Page()
```

At the core of JSServe you have `DOM` to create any HTML tag, `js"..."` to run Javascript, and `App` to wrap your creation and serve it anywhere:

```@example 1
using JSServe
app = App() do
    return DOM.div(DOM.h1("hello world"), js"""console.log('hello world')""")
end
```

App has three main signatures:
```julia
# The main signatures, all other signatures will end up calling:
App((session, request) -> DOM.div(...))
# Convenience constructors:
App((session::Session) -> DOM.div(...))
App((request::HTTP.Request) -> DOM.div(...))
App(() -> DOM.div(...))
App(DOM.div(...))
```

The app will be displayed by e.g. the VSCode plotpane, Jupyter/Pluto or any other framework that overloads the Julia display system for HTML display.
In the REPL or an environment without an HTML ready display, a browser should open to display it (enabled explicitly via `JSServe.browser_display()`), but one can also serve the App very easily:

```julia
server = Server(app, "0.0.0.0", 8080)
# This is the same as:
server = Server("0.0.0.0", 8080)
route!(server, "/" => app)
# So you can add many apps to one server, and even regexes are supported:
route!(server, r"*" => App(DOM.div("404, no content for this route")))
route!(server, "/some-app" => App(DOM.div("app")))
```

## Easy integration with existing JS + CSS libraries

It's quite easy to integrate existing Libraries into your JSServe App:

```@example 1
App() do
    js = ES6Module("https://esm.sh/v111/leaflet@1.9.3/es2022/leaflet.js")
    css = Asset("https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.css")
    map_div = DOM.div(id="map"; style="height: 300px; width: 100%")
    return DOM.div(
        css, map_div,
        js"""
        $(js).then(L=> {
            const map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);
            L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);
        })
        """
    )
end
```

## Deploying

`JSServe.jl` wants to run everywhere, from Notebooks, IDEs, Electron, to being directly inserted into existing web pages.
